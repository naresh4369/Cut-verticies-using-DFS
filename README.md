# Cut-verticies-using-DFS



// adj[] --> Adjacency List representation of the graph
// u --> The vertex to be visited next
// visited[] --> keeps track of visited vertices
// disc[] --> Stores discovery times of visited vertices
// low[] -- >> earliest visited vertex (the vertex with minimum
// discovery time) that can be reached from subtree
// rooted with current vertex
// parent --> Stores the parent vertex in DFS tree
// isAP[] --> Stores articulation points

A recursive function that find articulation points or cut vertices using DFS traversal.

Single file in CPP, we just need to execute.
